# RAG-FastAPI

The RAG FastAPI is an API that implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system. It takes a user's query, retrieves relevant context from a knowledge base, and then uses that context to generate a precise answer. This approach ensures the response is both accurate and well-informed by the provided data.
